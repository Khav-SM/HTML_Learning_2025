    - To change colour of texts use ```<h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">TEXT</h3>```.
        - In this instance the H3 refers to the Heading 3. H1 and H2 refer to their corresponding text headings.
    - .CSS flies are used for styling purposes, while the .JS is used for actions and .HMTL files are used for markup language.
    - You have to reference the .JS and .CSS in the .HTML file for it to source the required information from other files.
    - Always start a .HTML file with
          ``` <!DOCTYPE html>```  ```<html lang="en">```
    - Class= helps simplify the .HTML file by prompting an action/style by using a chosen word/phrase.

    - The positions (Top and Left) can have negative values and non-integer values.
    - ``` text-shadow: Xpx Ypx Zpx rgb(132, 98, 255)``` 
        - The X value represents the the horizontal position of the shadow in relation the text. An negative value indicates that the shadow is to the left of the text. Higher the value the further away from the text.
        - The Y value represents the the vertical position of the shadow in relation the text. An negative value indicates that the shadow is above the text. Higher the value the further away from the text.
        - The Z value represents the bluriness of the shadow and how defined it is. Higher the value = less definition.
    - You need to have ```position: absolute;``` in order to be able to change the positions of items/texts.
